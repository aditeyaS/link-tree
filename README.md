# LinkTree

This project lists down all my social profiles.
Feel free to fork the repo and use for yourself.

## Development

Add/remove data from [app.data.ts](https://github.com/aditeyaS/link-tree/blob/main/src/app/shared/data/app.data.ts) and do the same in the [assets folder](https://github.com/aditeyaS/link-tree/tree/main/src/assets)

NOTE 1: The name in app.data.ts should be same as image icon in assets
NOTE 2: The image should be in png

## Build

Run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /link-tree/` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.
